					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>
						This process will outline the best possible way to work through support cases. It will allow you to work through cases efficiently
						and effectively, while providing good notes along the way and keeping your time tracking up to date.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong> Everytime you touch a case, you should log time towards it. Generally, 15 minute increments work best.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<h3>Step 1 - The In Progress case</h3>
					<p>
						The first thing that needs to be worked on in this process is the In Progress case. You should <em>RARELY</em> have more then one case
						marked as In Progress at a time. With a maximum of two cases In Progress. This case will be the case you work on until you have come
						to a resolution, need more information on the case, or need assistance from escalation.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<h3>Step 2 - Emails</h3>
					<p>
						After you're finished with your In Progress case and you have updated the status to Need More Info, Fixed/Test, or Escalated 
						you're ready to check your email. Check each of your emails for any additional information, if a fix that was suggested worked
						or any other info for your cases. If there is a question you can answer in 5 minutes or less, respond to the question, add the 
						question and your response to the case, and make a note about the interaction. Otherwise add the email and a note to the case 
						and mark it appropriately.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Information has been given by customer - Case should be marked as Returned</li>
						<li>The fix suggested didn't work - the case should be marked as Returned</li>
						<li>The fix suggested <strong>DID</strong> work, and has resolved the root issue the case shold be solved out </li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Once you've cleared all incoming costomer emails from your inbox and added them to the case, add a case note,
						and updated the case status, move on to the next step.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<h3>Step 3 - Returned cases </h3>
					<p>
						Once your inbox is cleaned out you're ready to work on your returned cases. These include all cases that have been returned to you
						including (but not limited to):
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Returned from the Customer (Returned status, case closure request status, etc)</li>
						<li>Returned from Escalation (Returned from Escalation(Fixed/Test), Returned from Escalation(Need more Info), etc.)</li>
						<li>Bug Fixed</li>
						<li>Any other avenue that a case might be returned to you</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Work on each case by setting it to the In Progress status and working on the case. Work through steps 1-3 until you have no 
						more returned cases.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<h3>Step 4 - WOC(fixed/Test), WOC(Need More Info)</h3>
					<p>
						After all your returned cases are complete, next move on to the WOC fixed/test and need more info cases. This will NOT include
						the cases that you just potentially placed in Fixed/Test or Need More Info. For this step, make a phone call and if they don't 
						answer then send an email to each customer you need information from, or are waiting for them to test one of your fixes. After the
						phone call/email make a note on the case saying that you reached out, and how you reached out. <strong>Do not</strong> change the status of these cases unless you receive information back from the customer. This is important in tracking how long
						we are waiting for testing or information. I.E. cases shouldn't go from WOC need more info or fixed/test to in progress. If you
						get information back, it should go into the returned status. If a fix is verified the case should be closed.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong> A phone call/email should be sent per WOC case per day, unless they respond.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong> After 6 days of no response a message should be sent to the customer saying if there is no responce
						by tomorrow we'll have to close the case pending a response. Then on day 7 the customer should be called one last time and then
						the case should be closed if there still is no response.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there are multiple emails that happen on the same day, these should all be stored in the same note.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<h3>Step 5 - Queued Cases</h3>
					<p>
						The final step in the process is queued cases. After you've completed your In Progress case, sorted all your emails, returned cases,
						and contacted woc fixed/test and need more info cases, it's time to pick up a queued case. The first queue you will check is the queue
						for your team. If the queue for your team is empty, check the other teams queue and see if there is a case that you can pick up to 
						help them out. Add yourself as the lead support tech on this case, and mark it as In Progress. This will then become your In 
						Progress case and restarts your process at Step 1.
