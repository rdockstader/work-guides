					<h2 id="frontline-support">Frontline Support</h2>
					<p>
						Frontline support is the main group that will be in communication with our supported customers. Most
						interaction with support and our clients will go through this group.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Configuration Escalation</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						For any configuration requests (reports, new documents, eCourt configuration changes) that last longer 
						then <strong>15 minutes</strong> should be sent to account management. Our AM team has people that are more skilled
						specifically in these requests, and can provide the best experience possible for any newly added
						module/document/report/etc for our customers.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Support Escalation</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						For System down/critical cases, please refer to <a href="../system-down/">this process</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						For any case that can not be solved by the frontline support group, it should be sent to our escalated team. If you're
						unable to make progress on a case, and you've worked on it for 2 hours or longer it should be escalated. If you know
						that you've hit a roadblock before then it is also a good idea to consider escalating the case.
					</p>
					<p>
						Items Needed for escalating a support case:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Steps to Reproduce the issue</strong> These should be the steps to get the error or into the situation
								that you need assistance with. They should also list an environment <em>that can be accessed locally</em> to reproduce
								the issue (such as the support test environments).
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Customer Impact Statement</strong> This should specify which process this is affecting and how it is
								effecting that process
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Expected Results</strong> This should include the functionality that the customer is saying should be
								the result of the steps to reproduce the issue
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Actual Results</strong> This should include the error message, or the functionality that the customer
								is saying should not happen as a result of the steps to reproduce the issue
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong> Walk up support is also available if on a high priority phone call or you think the question will
						be fairly quick (5 minute answer or less)
					</p>

					<h2 id="escalated-support">Escalated Support</h2>
					<p>
						Escalated support is the first level of escalation in all instances. This level of support will come after the front line
						support level and should rarely communicate directly with a customer (outside of a system down/critical situation) without
						the frontline support tech there as well. Escalated support has access to all hosted environments as well as the product
						source code. 
					</p>
					<p>
						If the issue is unable to be solved by the escalated team or it appears that there is a bug in the product the escalated team
						will then escalate the case to the Solutions Architects.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row mb-3">
				<div class="col-12">
					<h2 id="solutions-architects">Solutions Architects</h2>
					<p>
						Solutions Architects are the third level of escalation, and the primary group that should be communicating with the 
						development teams. They also have access to all hosted environments as well as the product source code. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row mb-3">
				<div class="col-12">
					<h2 id="developer-support">Developer Support</h2>
					<p>
						This level of support is part of the Development department at JTI. Once a case reaches this level, it is either for
						a bug fix or an issue that cannot be resolved without someone with a deeper code knowledge then is available in support.
						All developer support/bug cases should be entered in by a Solutions Architect or escalated support. Frontline support
						should not need to speak directly with a member of the development department without a Solutions Architect involved.
					</p>

					<h3>Installation/Upgrade Cases</h3>
					<p>
						If a support case needs the customer to upgrade or install a new instance, a case should be added as a 
						Installations/Upgrade case. This can be done through EvoWeb, or by marking an Evolution Case as W.O.C. Upgrade.
						Our Instalations Architect is best equiped to handle any upgrade/installation that is needed for our customers. 
						He has flexibility in his schedule with allows him to find a time that works for him and the customer. 
						He will schedule the install/upgrade with the customer after the case has been created.
					</p>
					<h3>Enhancement Cases</h3>
					<p>
						Enhancement cases need to be reviewed by a Solutions Architect prior to being entered. The Solutions Architect may have
						an alternate way that it can already be acomplished, or know of a case that already exists. After it is reviewed by one
						of them, a support rep may enter the enhancement case. If there are any questions on how to enter an enhancement case
						ask a member of the escalated team.
