						The Rover will be an Escalated Rep that is assigned for that day to help Tier 1 with issues and questions. Everything from Tier 1 support will be directed to this rep for that day and will follow this process. The issues may be on incoming phone calls, existing cases or cases just picked up by the rep that day. The only instance where you do not go to the Rover is if you case has already been Escalated and an Escalated Rep has picked up that case.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The daily Rover will be posted <a href="/training/processes/phones/rotations/">here</a> as well as on the white board and via a reminder in slack</strong>
					</p>
					<h2>Rover Responsibilities and Expectations</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="pb-5">
							<p>
								<strong>5-15-minute</strong> questions answered on the spot by the Rover. This give plenty of time for the escalated rep to go to tier 1 repâ€™s computer (if needed) to help diagnose the issue and determine how to proceed, or if the issue can be reproduced. 
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>
										if <strong>longer then a 5-15 minute</strong> question and there is a <strong>way to repro</strong> on our side and get
										the user off the phone and <strong>escalate the case</strong>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									if the <strong>issue cannot be reproduced</strong> (affecting 1 user/1 computer or strange enough it can't be reproduced) in a restored or training environment, and cannot be resolved by Tier 1 - treat is as a <em>Critical Issue</em> where the Rover takes over the call and works on the issue right there &mdash; <strong>getting the rep off the phone to work on other cases and answer the phone</strong> &mdash; rather than working over the shoulder
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li class="pb-5">
							<p>
								We will be looking at who is escalating the most cases/what cases are being escalated to help determine Training.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
								 	If <strong>one rep</strong> is escalating a lot of similar cases/issues we will be able to schedule a room with a member of the Escalation Team to get some training on those issues.
								</li>
								<li >
									if <strong>many reps</strong> are escalating similar cases/issues we will be able to schedule a training to go over that item.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li class="pb-5">
							<p>
								If you answer a call that is a System Down &mdash; this will also go to the rover. For more information on our System Down process, click <a href="../system-down/">here</a>.

					<h2>Rovers Purpose</h2>
					<p>This will be a fluid process. As issue arise we will evaluate and adapt. The purpose will be to:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="pb-5">
							<p>
								Resolve Issues in a Timelier Manner by: 
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									Give the Escalated Team time to focus Primarily on the cases in the queue/their queue on the day they are not the Rover
								</li>
								<li>
									Give addition assistance/training to Tier 1 Support where needed
								</li>
								<li>
									Get Users off the phone as quickly as possible with a Process to move forward.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li class="pb-5">
							<p>
								Enforce Current Process 
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<em>Answer Phones</em> &mdash; If it is your day on the phones &mdash; get off the phone as quickly as possible. Put a case in the queue, escalate or transfer to escalation when needed.
								</li>
								<li>
									Work on To Do List using the Kanban process &mdash; see the details of the process <a href="/training/processes/general/kanban/">here</a> 
								</li>
								<li>
									Escalate Cases &mdash; when you are stuck and you know its going to be longer than 15 minutes to get an answer escalate the case with clear Steps to Repro. When the Escalated Tech picks up the case, they may determine the Rep needs additional training at the time, and schedule time with them to work on the case. If you do  your part, we will do our part. The more clear the Steps to Repro are the quicker we can move through cases. <strong>If you already have everything to a reproducible state with clear instructions we will be able to more quickly move through the cases and get the returned to you quicker.</strong> If you have questions about what Steps to Repro should be, ask. 
								</li>
								<li>
									<em>Work as a Team</em>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li class="pb-5">
							<p>
								Find out who and where escalated help is needed most
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									Once we know who and where help is needed we can do training.
